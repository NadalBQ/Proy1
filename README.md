# Proy1
Files needed for the execution of the web page and app designed for the subject "Proyecto1" at Universitat Politècnica de València.

If you wish to take advantage of the code available in this repository, you are more than welcome to do so. However, being my first project of this kind and bearing in mind the arbitrarity of the values which were taken into account for this analisys and development of the estimating model, I wouldn't rely on this code as a stable and useful one for any other project.
The objective of this project is not to make a good predictor, but to make the first steps towards making reliable models and understanding ML and AI for future projects.
